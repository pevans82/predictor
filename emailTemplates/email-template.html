These are allocated for home score difference (10), away score difference (10) and correct result difference (5).</p><p>By scoring home and away differences independently we've created many more possible scoring outcomes and less chance of everyone scoring the same number of points each round.</p><p>For examples, checkout the how to page <a href="https://www.superleigh.co.uk/how-to/">here</a></p><br><h2>Good luck for the new season !</h2><br><h3>The Super Leigh Team</h3><small><p>Struggling to sign in?</p><p>Your username is {{username}} and the sign in page provides an option to reset your password.</p></small></div></div></div></body></html>
